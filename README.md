# ClearStuckPrintJobs
A PowerShell script to monitor and clean print queues. It identifies print jobs stuck for more than 3 minutes, attempts to clear them, and restarts the print spooler service only when necessary. Includes logs for successful actions and errors, replacing them on each execution to keep files manageable.
